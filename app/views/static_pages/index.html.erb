				<p>
					There are 2 ways to make your bracket active in this year’s tournament:

					1: Get 3 friends to sign up using your referral link.  Post your link on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media to make sure you get as many friends as possible to sign up!  

					2: Make a donation of $5 or more for the charity you choose to sponsor through Brackets 4 Life.

				<h2>Additional Details</h2>
				<p>
					As the tournament progresses you’ll earn points for each correctly predicted winner.  We’ll post a leaderboard so you can see how you stack up against the competition.

				</p>
				<p>
					50% of any donation you make through Brackets for Life will go directly to the charity you choose to sponsor.  25% of your donation will go to Brackets 4 Life who will donate the money to the Christopher James McConville Fund for SIDS research purposes.  The remaining 25% will be divided up amongst the highest scoring brackets in this year’s tournament.  10% will go to the charity sponsored by our 1st place bracket, and 3% will go to the charities sponsored by the brackets that finish in 2nd through 6th place.
