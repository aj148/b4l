						<h2>Michael's Story</h2>
						<p>
							On July 2, 1996, the McConville family was blessed with the arrival of their second son, Christopher James. On December 2, 1996, Christopher's five month birthday, the family’s world was shattered when they lost their precious baby to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
						</p>
						<p>
							Over the past 9 years the McConville family has raised over $1 million for the CJ Foundation for SIDS. These much needed funds have given us the power to find answers to our questions and contribute to a future where every child has the opportunity to live life to its fullest.

						<h2>The Cube's Story</h2>
						<p>
							The Cube is a student entrepreneurship group at Duke University.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a friend of The Cube, Michael approached the group asking for help in the creation of a March Madness bracket website to raise money for SIDS. The Cube was enthusiastic about Michael’s idea and planned a hackathon to completely finish his project in one night.
							Since that night, members of the Cube has continued to develop and scale the technology over the past three years to what you see today.  We hope that one day, Brackets 4 Life will be <em>the</em> social venture that people look forward to returning to every single March.
