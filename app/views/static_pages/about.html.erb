						<h2>Michael's Story</h2>
						<p>
							On July 2, 1996, the McConville family was blessed with the arrival of their second son, Christopher James. On December 2, 1996, Christopher's five month birthday, the family’s world was shattered when they lost their precious baby to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
						</p>
						<p>
							Over the past 9 years the McConville family has raised over $1 million for the CJ Foundation for SIDS. These much needed funds have given us the power to find answers to our questions and contribute to a future where every child has the opportunity to live life to its fullest.

						<h2>The Cube's Story</h2>
						<p>
							The Cube is a student entrepreneurship group at Duke University.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a friend of The Cube, Michael approached us asking for help in the creation of a March Madness Bracket website to raise money for the CJ Foundation for SIDS. The Cube was enthusiastic about Michael’s idea and we planned a hackathon to completely finish his project in one night.

			<h1>Where We Are Now</h1>
			<p class="lead">After raising $6,000 in 2 years, we decided to continue working on Brackets4Life and give it a much needed facelift. Brackets4Life is currently in the process of obtaining 501(c)(3) non-profit status and we will continue to enhance the platform each year so that we can fully channel the energy and excitement of March Madness to help save lives.</p>
